		<li>They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists.</li>
		<li> We want people to come into our country...legally, legally.</li>

		<li> I judge people based on their capability, honesty, and merit.</li>
		<li> I’ll take jobs back from China; I’ll take jobs back from Japan… The Hispanics are going to get those jobs, and they’re going to love Trump.</li>
		<li>As everybody knows, but the haters & losers refuse to acknowledge, I do not wear a “wig.” My hair may not be perfect but it’s mine.</li>
		<li>Get going. Move forward. Aim High. Plan a takeoff. Don't just sit on the runway and hope someone will come along and push the airplane. It simply won't happen. Change your attitude and gain some altitude. Believe me, you'll love it up here.</li>
		<li>I like to think of the word FOCUS as Follow One Course Until Successful.</li>
		<li>What separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate.</li>
		<li>Sometimes by losing a battle you find a new way to win the war.</li>
